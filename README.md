LLM-Based Term Extraction Using Prompt Engineering
This project evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs)—ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini, and DeepSeek—for extracting domain-specific terms from Blockchain, Machine Learning, and Stock Market datasets. A prompt-based extraction framework is implemented to analyze the impact of general, context-aware, and hierarchical prompts on term retrieval accuracy. The study benchmarks model performance using Precision, Recall, F1-score, Jaccard Similarity, and RMSE, revealing key strengths and limitations. DeepSeek demonstrates balanced performance across domains, ChatGPT-3.5 excels in precision, while Gemini performs best in Blockchain-related term extraction. The project highlights the challenges of ambiguity, hallucination, and multi-word term fragmentation, suggesting hybrid models and domain-adaptive fine-tuning for improved term extraction accuracy.
